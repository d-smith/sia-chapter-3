Buy the book.

Set up went mostly as described in the book. The maven catalog pull does
not work in the Scala IDE version of eclipese even with the proxy

connected to the internet. You will also need to select your maven
profile in the maven config to download the internet for the initial build.

Note the book has been significantly updated since the above comment was added.

Currently looking at the vm setup needed for submitting jobs.
